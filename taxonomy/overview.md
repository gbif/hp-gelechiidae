Introduction
The family Gelechiidae (Lepidoptera: Gelechioidea) is among the most extensive families within microlepidoptera, comprising approximately 4,700 described species spread across roughly 500 genera globally (Pohl and Nanz, 2023). 

Recent studies have delved into the higher-level taxonomy of Gelechiidae. The classification utilized here aligns with the genetic analysis conducted by Karsholt et al. (2013). Subsequent genetic research by Heikkil√§ et al. (2014) and Sohn et al. (2016) focusing on more limited intra-familial taxon sampling,  generally corroborated the subfamily level proposed by Karsholt et al. (2013), as employed in recent publications such as the European checklist by Huemer & Karsholt (2020) and associated barcode library (Huemer et al., 2020). Lee and Landry (2023) have recently compiled a checklist of North American species. Despite these efforts, the family's understanding remains incomplete, with numerous species yet to be discovered and described.

Key Features
Gelechiidae are characterized by distinct features including their scaled proboscis and recurved labial palpus, setting them apart from similar families. Their wings and palpi exhibit notable characteristics such as hindwings that are subrectangular to trapezoidal with a sinuous or concave termen and a prominent apex, forewings that are lanceolate to elongate-ovate with CuP absent, the retinaculum of the wing-coupling mechanism located on the radial vein of the female forewing, elongated labial palpi often with a ventral brush on the second segment, and a male gnathos forming a pair of lateral, articulated, symmetrical sclerites with an articulated, mesial hook (Hodges, 1986, 1999).

Ecology and Biology
Most Gelechiidae species in the temperate Nearctic region are univoltine, while many in southern latitudes have two or more broods per year. Among the various species, hibernation may occur in egg, larval or pupal stages (Hodges, 1986, 1999). Adults of most species are active at dusk or during the night and can be collected at light, although a few are predominately diurnal. 

Gelechiidae exhibit a wide range of feeding strategies, including scavenging, insect predation, lichen feeding, leaf rolling or mining, stem and root boring, gall forming, and case-making. They feed on plants from 108 families, with primary hosts in the Northern Hemisphere include (in decreasing order): Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Fagaceae, Rosaceae, Betulaceae/Salicaceae, Pinaceae, Solanaceae.
